# Task Description
Diode and Transistor Detection:
An arduino-based circuit should be able to detect diodes and transistors as well as the anode and catode of an connected diode, or the base, collector and emitter of an transistor. Indication of the detection results should be done via LEDs. The constructed circuit has to have appropriate drop-in contacts for the elements and self-explaining (labeled) LEDs.
